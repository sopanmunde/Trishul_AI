These enzymes act like acid,killing thegerms and breaking them down into small pieces that canbe picked up by the circulation and eliminated from thebody.

Once suspected,a number of bloodtests can lead to the diagnosis of Addison’s disease. It isnot sufficient to demonstrate low blood cortisol levels,as normal levels of cortisol vary quite widely. Instead,patients are given a testing dose of another hormonecalled corticotropin (ACTH). ACTH is produced in thebody by the pituitary gland,and normally acts by pro-moting growth within the adrenal cortex and stimulatingthe production and release of cortisol. In Addison’s dis-ease,even a dose of synthetic ACTH does not increasecortisol levels.To distinguish between primary adrenocorticalinsufficiency (Addison’s disease) and secondaryadrenocortical insufficiency (caused by failure of thepituitary to produce enough ACTH),levels of ACTH inthe blood are examined.

Nor-mally,the immune system responds to foreign microor-ganisms and particles,like pollen or dust,by producingspecific proteins called antibodies that are capable ofbinding to identifying molecules,or antigens,on theforeign organisms. This reaction between antibody andantigen sets off a series of reactions designed to protectthe body from infection. Sometimes,this same series ofreactions is triggered by harmless,everyday substances.This is the condition known as allergy,and the offend-ing substance is called an allergen.

While very frightening for the patient,tran-sient global amnesia generally has an excellent progno-sis for recovery.DiagnosisIn diagnosing amnesia and its cause,doctors look atseveral factors. During a physical examination,the doc-tor inquires about recent traumas or illnesses,drug andmedication history,and checks the patient’s generalhealth. Psychological exams may be ordered to deter-mine the extent of amnesia and the memory systemaffected.

Itis also recommended for women who have already bornechildren with birth defects,or when either of the parentshas a family history of a birth defect for which a diagnos-tic test is available.

Thirty-five is the recommended age to beginamnio testing because that is the age at which the risk ofcarrying a fetus with such a defect roughly equals therisk of miscarriagecaused by the procedure—aboutone in 200. At age 25,the risk of giving birth to a childwith this type of defect is about one in 1,400; by age 45it increases to about one in 20. Nearly half of all preg-nant women over 35 in the United States undergoamniocentesis and many younger women also decide tohave the procedure. Notably,some 75% of all Downsyndrome infants born in the United States each year areto women younger than 35.One of the most common reasons for performingamniocentesis is an abnormal alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)test.

Nearly 85% of people develop acne at some timebetween the ages of 12-25 years. Up to 20% of womendevelop mild acne.

ARDS is not itself a specific disease,but a syn-drome,a group of symptoms and signs that make up oneof the most important forms of lung or respiratory fail-ure. It can develop quite suddenly in persons whoselungs have been perfectly normal. Very often ARDS is atrue medical emergency. The basic fault is a breakdownof the barrier,or membrane,that normally keeps fluidfrom leaking out of the small blood vessels of the lunginto the breathing sacs (the alveoli).DescriptionAnother name for ARDS is shock lung.

One ofhis most startling discoveries was that in order to changethe way he used his body he had to change the way hewas thinking,redirecting his thoughts in such a way thathe did not produce unnecessary tension when he attempt-ed speech or movement.

If the neck muscles are not over-tensed,thehead will carry slightly forward of the spine,simplybecause it is heavier in the front.

Nor-mally,the immune system responds to foreign microor-ganisms and particles,like pollen or dust,by producingspecific proteins called antibodies that are capable ofbinding to identifying molecules,or antigens,on theforeign organisms. This reaction between antibody andantigen sets off a series of reactions designed to protectthe body from infection. Sometimes,this same series ofreactions is triggered by harmless,everyday substances.This is the condition known as allergy,and the offend-ing substance is called an allergen.

The disease may also affect theintestines,liver,or other parts of the body.DescriptionAmebiasis,also known as amebic dysentery,is oneof the most common parasitic diseases occurring inhumans,with an estimated 500 million new cases eachyear.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Medical_book.pdf'}, page_content='Abdominal ultrasoundDefinitionUltrasound technology allows doctors to “see”inside a patient without resorting to surgery. A transmit-ter sends high frequency sound waves into the body,where they bounce off the different tissues and organs toproduce a distinctive pattern of echoes. A receiver“hears”the returning echo pattern and forwards it to acomputer,which translates the data into an image on atelevision screen. Because ultrasound can distinguishsubtle variations between soft,fluid-filled tissues,it isparticularly useful in providing diagnostic images of theabdomen. Ultrasound can also be used in treatment.PurposeThe potential medical applications of ultrasoundwere first recognized in the 1940s as an outgrowth of thesonar technology developed to detect submarines duringWorld War II.

Some survive into early adolescence.Causes and symptomsBecause HIV destroys immune system cells,AIDSis a disease that can affect any of the body’s major organsystems. HIV attacks the body through three diseaseprocesses:immunodeficiency,autoimmunity,and ner-vous system dysfunction.Immunodeficiency describes the condition in whichthe body’s immune response is damaged,weakened,or isnot functioning properly. In AIDS,immunodeficiencyresults from the way that the virus binds to a protein calledCD4,which is primarily found on the surface of certainsubtypes of white blood cells called helper T cells or CD4cells. After the virus has attached to the CD4 receptor,thevirus-CD4 complex refolds to uncover another receptorcalled a chemokine receptor that helps to mediate entry ofthe virus into the cell.

Because many alcoholics have very stressfullives (whether because of or leading to the alcoholism issometimes a matter of debate),many of the treatments foralcoholism involve dealing with and relieving stress. Theseinclude massage,meditation,and hypnotherapy. Themalnutrition of long-term alcohol use is addressed by nutri-tion-oriented practitioners with careful attention to ahealthy diet and the use of nutritional supplements such asvitaminsA,B complex,and C,as well as certain fattyacids,amino acids,zinc,magnesium,and selenium.

They may even be awarethat they suffer from a memory disorder.People who experience amnesia have been instrumen-tal in helping brain researchers determine how the brainprocesses memory. Until the early 1970s,researchersviewed memory as a single entity. Memory of new experi-ences,motor skills,past events,and previous conditioningwere grouped together in one system that relied on a spe-cific area of the brain.If all memory were stored in the same way,it wouldbe reasonable to deduce that damage to the specific brainarea would cause complete memory loss.

Most are traceableto brain injury related to physical trauma,disease,infec-tion,drug and alcohol abuse,or reduced blood flow tothe brain (vascular insufficiency). In Wernicke-Korsakoffsyndrome,for example,damage to the memory centersof the brain results from the use of alcohol or malnutri-tion. Infections that damage brain tissue,includingencephalitisand herpes,can also cause amnesia. If theamnesia is thought to be of psychological origin,it istermed psychogenic.There are at least three general types of amnesia:•Anterograde.

While very frightening for the patient,tran-sient global amnesia generally has an excellent progno-sis for recovery.DiagnosisIn diagnosing amnesia and its cause,doctors look atseveral factors. During a physical examination,the doc-tor inquires about recent traumas or illnesses,drug andmedication history,and checks the patient’s generalhealth. Psychological exams may be ordered to deter-mine the extent of amnesia and the memory systemaffected.

At age 25,the risk of giving birth to a childwith this type of defect is about one in 1,400; by age 45it increases to about one in 20. Nearly half of all preg-nant women over 35 in the United States undergoamniocentesis and many younger women also decide tohave the procedure. Notably,some 75% of all Downsyndrome infants born in the United States each year areto women younger than 35.One of the most common reasons for performingamniocentesis is an abnormal alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)test.
